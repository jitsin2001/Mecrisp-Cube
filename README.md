# Mecrisp-Cube

Mecrisp-Stellaris Forth for the STM32 Cube ecosystem. Only the STM32WB is supported yet. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [STM32WB Nucleo Board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/p-nucleo-wb55.html) - 
* []() - Terminal program like 

    STM32CubeMX
    STM32CubeIDE 

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) - 
  STM32CubeIDE is an all-in-one multi-OS development tool, 
  which is part of the STM32Cube software ecosystem. The IDE is used for 
  development, GCC tools are included.
* [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) - 
  STM32CubeMX is a graphical tool that allows a very easy configuration of 
  STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors, as well as the generation of 
  the corresponding initialization C code for the Arm® Cortex®-M core or a 
  partial Linux® Device Tree for Arm® Cortex®-A core), through a step-by-step process. 
* [STM32CubeProg](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) - 
  STM32CubeProgrammer (STM32CubeProg) is an all-in-one multi-OS software 
  tool for programming STM32 products. 

The STM tools work on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
